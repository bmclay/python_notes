"""
Performing mathmatical operations in python.
Numeric expressions are +, -, *, /, **, %
You cannot perform every mathmatical operations on a string.
One exception is *, which can be performed on a string.
When combined with print, you can specify the amount of times the string will be printed.
"""
print('hello ' *9)

# Numbers (int or float) can be assigned to variables and then used in mathmatical operations.
x = 9
y = 3.5
result = x - y
print(result)

# Python will show float by default, even on a whole number.
z = 8
a = 2
result = z / a
print(result)

# If you dont want the result to be a float, specify int.
num1 = 50
num2 = 25
result = int(num1 / num2)
print(result)

# Exponent: ** can be used to raise numbers to the power of a specified value
num3 = 10
num4 = 5

# Value of num3 to the power of the value of num4
result = num3 ** num4
print(result)

# Use integer division: // to remove all of the decimal points and return the integer value
# The real answer of 10 / 3 is 3.333333333333333, but floor division will take away everything right of the decimal point.
num5 = 10
num6 = 3
result = num5 // num6
print(result)

# Use mod: % to show ONLY the remainder after a division occurs
num7 = 10
num8 = 3
result = num7 % num8
print(result)

"""
Order of operation is important. Python follows the simple order of operations to evaluate expressions.
To remember, use the acronym BEDMAS Brackets Exponenets Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction. Integer division and mod operators are last. 
You can operate on user input with integers using the int function.
"""
num = input('Number: ')
print(int(num) - 5)

# You can do the same with a float.
num = input('Number: ')
print(float(num) - 5)

# By default Python 3 will always print a floating point number during math:
print(10 / 2)
